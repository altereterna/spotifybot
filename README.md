Installation

Prerequisites
Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Dependencies: Dependencies are automatically installed as part of the setup process.

Installation Steps

Run Installer Script:

Execute install & run.bat.
This script checks for Python installation, creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and launches the configuration UI.

Configure Bot:

Open config_ui.py to configure Spotify and Twitch credentials.
Save the credentials to credentials.txt using the UI.

Start the Bot:

Once configured, run spoti.py to start the bot and connect it to Twitch and Spotify.
Usage
Customize exceptions.txt to add users that allowed to use your bot (you should add your name too)

Use Twitch chat commands (%np, %sr, %skip, %vol, etc.) to interact with the bot during live streams.
