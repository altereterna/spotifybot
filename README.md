## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are automatically installed as part of the setup process.

### Installation Steps

1. **Run Installer Script:**
   - Execute `install & run.bat`. This script checks for Python installation, creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and launches the configuration UI.

2. **Configure Bot:**
   - Open `config_ui.py` to configure Spotify and Twitch credentials.
   - Save the credentials to `credentials.txt` using the UI.

3. **Start the Bot:**
   - Once configured, run `spoti.py` to start the bot and connect it to Twitch and Spotify.

## Usage

- **Customize exceptions.txt:** Add users allowed to use your bot (including your own name).

- **Use Twitch Chat Commands:**
  - Utilize commands like `%np`, `%sr`, `%skip`, `%vol`, etc. to interact with the bot during live streams.
